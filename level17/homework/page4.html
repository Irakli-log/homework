 <p><h1>pagani zonda R</h1></p>
 <p><h2>The Pagani Zonda R[1] is a track day car developed and manufactured by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani. It debuted at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, using the 6.0-litre GT 112 engine sourced from the racing version of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR.[2] The Zonda R's competition lies with track-based cars, such as the Ferrari FXX and Maserati MC12 Corse rather than the original Zonda's road competitors as it is not road-legal.

    Despite sharing much of the Zonda's shape, the R is almost entirely new, sharing only 10% of the Zonda F's components. It has been obliquely suggested by Horacio Pagani that this car is a testbed chassis for certain components of the Zonda's replacement, the Huayra (in the same vein as the Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione and the successive F40) and that the Zonda R accurately reflects some of the Huayra's features. Only 15 Zonda Rs were produced along with an additional 5 Zonda RevoluÄ‡ion cars and the Zonda R prototype.</h2></p>
