  <P>The Dodge Viper is a sports car that was manufactured by Dodge (by SRT for 2013 and 2014), a division 
    of American car manufacturer Chrysler from 1992 until 2017, having taken a brief hiatus in 2007 and from 
    2010 to 2012. Production of the two-seat sports car began at New Mack Assembly Plant in 1991 and moved to 
    Conner Avenue Assembly Plant in October 1995.

    Although Chrysler considered ending production because of serious financial 
    problems,on September 14, 2010, then chief executive Sergio Marchionne announced and previewed 
    a new model of the Viper for 2012.[3] In 2014, the Viper was named number 10 on the "Most American Cars" 
    list, meaning 75% or more of its parts are manufactured in the U.S. The Viper was eventually discontinued 
    in 2017 after approximately 32,000 were produced over the 26 years of production.
    
    The 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) time on a Viper varies from around 3.5 to 4.5 seconds. Top speed ranges
     from 160 mph (260 km/h) to over 200 mph (320 km/h), depending on variant and year.</P>
