    Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[9] is 
    an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in 
    the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with
     the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s
      and 1990s,[10] becoming a global cultural icon.[11] His profile on the NBA website states, "By acclamation, 
      Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."[12][13]

Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was 
a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 
1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][14] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining 
crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players.
His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, 
earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness".[5][14] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls 
in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and 
mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA 
season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and 
led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the
 1995–96 NBA season.[5] Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001
  to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][14] He was selected to play for the United States national team during 
  his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament 
  of the Americas and 1992 Summer 
Olympics—while also being undefeated.[16]
