    Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbi/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020)
     was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent
      his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball
       Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest and most influential 
       players of all time, Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star, 
       15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most 
       Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. He ranks fourth in league all-time regular 
       season and postseason scoring. Bryant was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball 
       Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

     The son of NBA player Joe Bryant, Bryant was born in Philadelphia 
     and partly raised in Italy. Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while 
     at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion, Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by 
     the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant 
      earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and was named an All-Star
      by his second season. Despite his contentious relationship with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair 
      led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was charged 
      with sexual assault. Charges were dropped after the accuser refused to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court, 
     with Bryant issuing an apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual.
