  <P>The Porsche 911 model series (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelf) is a family of two-door, high 
    performance rear-engine sports cars, introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. Now in its 
    eighth generation, all 911s have a rear-mounted flat-six engine, and usually 2+2 seating, except for special 2-seater
     variants. Originally, 911s had air-cooled engines, and torsion bar suspension, but the 911 has been continuously enhanced, 
     and evolved across generations. Though the 911 core concept has remained largely unchanged, water-cooled engines were 
     introduced with the 996 series in 1998, and front and rear suspension have been replaced by Porsche-specific MacPherson 
     suspension up front, and independent multi-link rear suspension.

    The 911 has been raced extensively by private and factory 
    teams, in a variety of classes. It is among the most successful
     competition cars. In the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world championship 
     races including Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours 
     of Le Mans in 1979. Porsche won the World Championship for Makes in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 with 911-derived models.
    
    In a 1999 poll to determine the Car of the Century, 
    the 911 was fifth.[4] It is one of two in the top five that had remained continuously in production 
    (the original Beetle remained in production until 2003). The 
    one millionth example was manufactured in May 2017 and is in the company's permanent collection.</P>
