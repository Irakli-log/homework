    <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 
        5 February 1992), also known as Neymar Júnior or simply Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who 
        plays as a left winger, attacking midfielder or forward for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Brazil 
        national team. Widely regarded as one of the best players of all time, he is known for his skills, dribbling, 
        playmaking, and finishing.[8] Neymar is one of the few players to have scored at least 100 goals for three different 
        clubs. He is the highest-scoring Brazilian in the UEFA Champions League and is also Brazil's all-time top goalscorer.

        Neymar made his professional debut with Santos in 2009. In 2011, he
         helped them win their first Copa Libertadores in nearly 50 years.
         In 2013, he joined Barcelona and became part of an attacking trio with 
         Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN. Winning the continental treble
          of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League in the trio's first
          season, Neymar was the joint-top goalscorer of the Champions League campaign and 
          top goalscorer of the Copa del Rey. In his final season, Neymar reached 100 goals for 
          Barcelona and set the record for most assists in a Champions League campaign. Motivated 
          to assume focal responsibility, Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2017 for a transfer 
          worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] He largely contributed to PSG's
          continuation of Ligue 1 title dominance and PSG reaching its first Champions League final, whilst establishing
            himself as one of the club's highest ever scorers. Continuing injuries caused PSG to sell him in 2023 to Al Hilal 
            for €90 million, a Saudi Pro League record transfer.
        
        At 18, Neymar debuted for Brazil. He is the nation's all-time top 
        goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 matches. He won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning 
        the Golden Ball. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was named in the Dream Team. He captained Brazil 
        to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football in the 2016 Summer Olympics and won a silver medal at
         the 2012 edition. He helped Brazil finish runner-up to Argentina in the 2021 Copa América and was jointly 
         awarded Best Player. In the 2022 World Cup, he became the third Brazilian player to score in three World Cups 
         after Pelé and Ronaldo. Neymar has won a record six Samba Gold awards.
        
        Neymar was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11, the UEFA Team of the Year twice, and the UEFA
         Champions League Squad of the Season three times. He finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 
         2015 and 2017 and won the FIFA Puskás Award in 2011. SportsPro named Neymar the world's most marketable
          athlete in 2012 and 2013. In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential
           people in the world.France Football ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid footballer of 2018. Forbes ranked him the world's 
        third-highest-paid athlete of 2019,and dropped him to fourth in 2020
