     The Pagani Zonda R[1] is a track day car developed and manufactured by Italian sports car
     manufacturer Pagani. It debuted at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, using the 6.0-litre GT 112 
     engine sourced from the racing version of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR.[2] The Zonda R's competition 
     lies with track-based cars, such as the Ferrari FXX and Maserati MC12 Corse rather than the original
     Zonda's road competitors as it is not road-legal.

     Despite sharing much of the Zonda's shape, the R is almost entirely new, sharing only 10% of the Zonda
     F's components. It has been obliquely suggested by Horacio Pagani that this car is a testbed chassis for certain 
     components of the Zonda's replacement, the Huayra (in the same vein as the Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione and the successive F40) 
     and that the Zonda R accurately reflects some of the Huayra's features. Only 15 Zonda Rs were produced along with 
     an additional 5 Zonda Revolućion cars and the Zonda R prototype.
     Chassis
     The central carbon chassis incorporates a roll cage and a rubber racing fuel cell with 4 fuel pumps and quick refuel filler 
     cap, similar to GT race cars. The wheelbase has been increased by 47 mm (1.9 in) to increase stability. The front and rear subframes
      are brand-new, built to accommodate new suspension geometry, and produced in Avional. The slick-shod wheels are new forged-magnesium
       center-lock models, which in conjunction with on-board pneumatic airjacks allow rapid change of the entire wheel assemblies.
     The car senses, displays and logs information about the amount of down-force that is generated at each wheel
     at all times. It is thought that this system will enable owners to adjust set-up according to track conditions 
     and to improve their cornering technique.
        
     Bodywork
     In addition to the wheelbase increase (47 mm), overall
     length has increased by 394 mm (15.5 in) and track by 50 mm (2.0 in). The bodywork and
     aerodynamics have been altered to offer maximum down-force, featuring a longer front 
     bonnet with flaps, a closed underbody and a new rear overhang with adjustable
     rear wing and race-derived diffuser. These are intended to translate into increased
     aerodynamic efficiency and down-force for maximum cornering speed. It is also noted 
     that the car's new rear bodywork is minimal in the extreme, being composed mostly of vent. 
     This is thought to be symptomatic of the need to keep the engine cool enough, even under hard track use.[3]
     The engine, although shared with the Mercedes CLK-GTR, has been modified and has an increased power output of 750 
     PS (552 kW; 740 hp) at 7,500 rpm and 710 N⋅m (524 lb⋅ft) of torque. And a specific power output of 125 PS/litre. A 
     lightweight carbon fibre high performance intake system, racing multiple disc centered clutch and Formula One-style 
     exhaust system, hydroformed in Inconel 625 and ceramic coated for optimal heat dissipation, have been added. 
     The AMG-built engine is mated to a 6-speed 
     longitudinally-mounted manual sequential synchronized gearbox manufactured by Xtrac.[4]
